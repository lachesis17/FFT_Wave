- Generate two waves (Sine, Square, Triangle, Saw) at given Frequencies, Amplitudes and Sample Rates from 0.2 to 200 (ms)
- Combines both waves and performs FFT on each individual wave and the combined
- Plot all waves and their FFT in a matplotlib window
- Use a Hann Window on the FFT
- Play buttons for each wave (renders each wave to a 1 second .wav to play with QMediaPlayer)
- [Download .exe in .zip here.](https://github.com/lachesis17/Wave_Generator/releases)
